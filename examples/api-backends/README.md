# API Backends

Examples in this directory are intended to provide basic working backend CSRF-protected APIs,
compatible with the JavaScript frontend examples available in the
[`examples/javascript-frontends`](../javascript-frontends).

In addition to CSRF protection, these backends provide the CORS configuration required for
communicating the CSRF cookies and headers with JavaScript client code running in the browser.

See [`examples/javascript-frontends`](../javascript-frontends/README.md) for details on CORS and
CSRF configuration compatibility requirements.
